# Experts

An opinionated panel of experts implementation using OpenAI's Assistants API

## Setup

This project leverages [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) meaning you can open it in any supporting IDE and get started right away. This includes using [VS Code with Dev Containers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1RavPr_878) which is the recommended approach.

Once opened in your development container, create a `.env.development.local` file with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Now you can run the following commands:

```bash
./bin/setup
./bin/test
```
